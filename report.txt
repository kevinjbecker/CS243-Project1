[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

	[MAKE ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. USE 'BULLET POINT' OUTLINES.]

	[USE PLAIN TEXT]


============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?

[e.g. does it run right or crash, infinite loop when it should not, other?]

	[you will lose fewer points if 
	 you clearly describe the problems
	 and your work to solve those problems.]
 *  My program is in fully working status to the specifications requested.
 *  Program ``runs right'' and switches between modes depending on how program
    started.



============= PROGRAM USAGE, OPTIONS AND Extra Credit ==

If you implemented extra credit or special, describe your results here.

[see the writeup for extra credit requirements if this applies to your work.]



============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

I learned how to use arrays in C as well as other C standard utilities like the
getopt function as well as getting a solid understanding of proper C syntax.


What was easy about this assignment?

It was relatively easy to get the simulation set up as it was a pretty close 
match to the lab we had done before with Game of Life.


What gave you problems or troubles?

I encountered a few problems with the logic of trees catching fire (what counts
as neighbors, etc.).  All easily overcome with a bit of time and thought.


What would you like the instructor to do to improve this assignment?

The assignment write-up was a bit unclear at points, it would be a great 
improvement to clean it up and make it a bit more concise.  As it stands, it is
very cluttered, but not to the point of confusion.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

I really would have liked to have more time to create more of the extra credit
options, they seemed like a fun challenge to tackle, and certainly doable with a
bit more time.
